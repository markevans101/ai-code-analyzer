Suggestions for improvements:

1. Add type hints to function parameters and return types for better readability and autocompletion support.
2. Use context managers (`with` statement) for opening files to ensure they are properly closed even when exceptions occur.
3. Instead of using a bare `except` clause, use specific exception types to avoid catching unexpected errors.
4. Use f-strings for better performance and readability when concatenating strings.
5. Consider using a linter like Flake8 or Black to enforce consistent coding styles and catch potential errors.
6. For better error handling, include informative error messages and stack traces in exceptions.
7. Use `is` and `is not` for comparing with `None` instead of `==` and `!=`.
8. Use `typing.List` and `typing.Dict` instead of built-in `list` and `dict` for type hints.
9. Use `pathlib` for handling file paths, as it provides a more readable and modern API.
10. Use `str.format()` or f-strings for formatting strings instead of using the `%` operator.
